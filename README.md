# Strava Stats

This application integrates with the Strava API to provide in-depth analysis of a user's running statistics and generate interesting metrics from their past runs.

## Project Overview

The Strava Stats Analyzer offers runners a comprehensive view of their performance and progress over time. Key features include:

- Strava API integration for accessing user running data
- Analysis of past runs to extract meaningful statistics

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Tourniercy/Stravastats.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Stravastats
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   yarn install
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
    - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`
    - Update the variables in `.env.local` with your Strava API credentials and other configuration details

5. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
